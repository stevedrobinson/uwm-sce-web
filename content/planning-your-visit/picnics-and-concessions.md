## Picnics
Follow the signs from the parking lot to a spacious green & clean picnic area where your family enjoy a meal. Groups can reserve the covered pavillion complete with sound system, buffet style serving area and group tables. Groups using the pavillion can rent a gas grill for a nominal fee. No fires or grills are permitted in the picnic area.

## Concessions
A concession booth next to the picnic area offers a burger & fries menu for your convenience.
